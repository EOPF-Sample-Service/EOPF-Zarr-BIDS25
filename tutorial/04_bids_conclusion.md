The main aim of this tutorial was to **introduce** you to a **faster** and **more efficient** way of **accessing Sentinel** data. Rather than using traditional downloads, we demonstrated a direct-access, cloud-native approach.

### What we will learned...

- üîç What STAC is and why it is a critical community standard.
- üå≥ How to navigate the STAC ecosystem.
- üî¶ How to explore and find data within the **EOPF Sentinel Zarr Samples Service STAC Catalog**.


## Importance of Cloud Optimised Formats

Shifting to **cloud-optimised** formats such as `zarr` is essential for contemporary **Earth Observation** workflows as it significantly reduces latency and computational overhead when accessing data.<br>

Leveraging this cloud-native data access enables us to achieve **faster and easier response times** for EO workflows, leading to quicker insights and more **agile development cycles**.<br>

## Missions Integration
Integrating data from multiple sources efficiently is key to accelerating our understanding of the current state of the Earth and enabling more comprehensive analysis.<br>

## The EOPF STAC Catalog and Data Access

For the **EOPF** initiative, the STAC structure is specifically applied to Sentinel data:<br>

Adopting the **SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)** standard enhances the **replicability** and **reusability** of data within specific workflows, fostering a more collaborative and standardised EO ecosystem.
